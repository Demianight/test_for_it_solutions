# Test for it-solutions

## Overview

This project is a simple API built using FastAPI and SQLAlchemy. It provides endpoints for creating and retrieving user information and implements nearly full CRUD operations for announcement objects. Note that this was my first time using FastAPI and SQLAlchemy together, so there might be some room for improvement in terms of best practices.

## Features

- Endpoints to show and create user information.
- Full(almost) CRUD operations for announcement objects.
- Built with FastAPI and SQLAlchemy.
- Few important comments in the code. 


## Usage

You can access docs and try endpoints yourself if you run the app (I believe you will figure it out) at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.
The only requirement is ```pip install "fastapi[all]"```


## Other
It took me around 2-3 hours to finish. 
It took long in terms of days cause I was busy fixing the roof in my countryside-house.
